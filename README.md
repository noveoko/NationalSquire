## JD Vance Joins Boyscouts

WASHINGTON, D.C. — In an unprecedented move, President Trump signed Executive Order 14723-56vn today, granting Senator JD Vance (R-OH) special permission to join the Boy Scouts of America at the age of 40. The order, citing "patriotic enrichment and leadership immersion," allows Vance to enter the organization as a first-year Scout, bypassing age restrictions.

“This is about going back to our roots,” Vance said in a press conference, proudly displaying his freshly earned "Fire Safety" badge. “America needs leaders who understand discipline, survival, and knot-tying. We need more young men — and, apparently, middle-aged ones — who embrace the values of scouting.”

The decision has sparked debate. While supporters hail it as an inspiring example of lifelong learning, critics argue that it sets a strange precedent. “What’s next? AARP opening its doors to toddlers?” quipped political analyst Sam Whitmore.

Despite the controversy, Vance has thrown himself into scouting life. He has been seen participating in troop meetings, camping trips, and even selling popcorn door-to-door. Rumors abound that he is particularly eager to earn his "Citizenship in the Nation" merit badge, though sources indicate he struggled with the written portion.

When asked if he planned to go all the way to Eagle Scout, Vance chuckled. “That depends on how well I do in orienteering,” he admitted. “I’m still working on my compass skills

## Iron Curtain CrossFit: Marjorie and Jean-Claude’s Slavic Sweat Revolution

In an unprecedented partnership that left both political analysts and fitness experts scratching their heads, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and action movie legend Jean-Claude Van Damme announced the grand opening of their new CrossFit gym chain, Iron Curtain CrossFit, across the great nation of Belarus.

“This is about FREEDOM and FITNESS,” Greene declared at the Minsk grand opening, flexing her biceps while standing next to a life-size cardboard cutout of herself draped in an American flag. “The deep state doesn’t want you to be strong, but we’re here to change that.”

Van Damme, dressed in a red tracksuit and practicing his signature splits between two kettlebells, nodded solemnly. “Strength is not just muscle. Strength is discipline, power, and the ability to do a spinning back-kick on demand,” he said in a thick Belgian accent, despite speaking flawless English.

## The Vision: Part Fitness, Part Political Re-Education

The gym franchise, with locations popping up from Minsk to Gomel, boasted an intense, if unconventional, regimen. Workouts included:

- **The Deep State Deadlift**: Participants deadlift a weighted ballot box rumored to contain rigged election votes from Georgia.
- **The Soviet Split**: Inspired by Van Damme’s famous flexibility, gym-goers must perform splits over two Soviet-era tanks while listening to motivational speeches about personal liberty.
- **The Putin Press**: A bench press challenge where lifters are encouraged to “press through the lies of mainstream media.”
- **Bear Wrestling Cool-Down**: A post-workout relaxation technique involving light grappling with a mildly sedated Belarusian bear named “Democracy.”

## Lukashenko Endorses the Movement

In a shocking turn of events, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko gave Iron Curtain CrossFit his full endorsement. “I see in Marjorie Taylor Greene the same visionary leadership I see in myself,” he declared while personally demonstrating a 250kg squat. “And Van Damme? He reminds me of my youth, when I too could do the splits. This is a good fitness program for strong Belarus.”

Some gym members, however, were less convinced. “I thought this was just going to be normal CrossFit,” said Dimitri, a confused Minsk local. “But now I’m listening to conspiracy theories about Jewish space lasers while swinging a kettlebell shaped like Donald Trump’s head.”

## Global Expansion Plans

Despite international skepticism, Greene and Van Damme have ambitious plans. “First Belarus,” Greene shouted at a press conference, “then we take Moscow! And then… back to America, where we’ll be STRONG ENOUGH to fight the REAL enemy—vegan yoga instructors!”

Van Damme, wiping sweat from his brow, simply smiled. “Fitness is the bridge between worlds,” he whispered, before executing a perfect roundhouse kick through a life-size cardboard cutout of Anthony Fauci.

## Final Thoughts

Only time will tell if Iron Curtain CrossFit will become a global phenomenon or collapse under the weight of its own absurdity. Until then, Belarusian citizens can enjoy the sight of Jean-Claude Van Damme doing slow-motion punches in the snow while Marjorie Taylor Greene screams about chemtrails in the background.

The future of fitness has never been more… confusing.

# Matt Gaetz Goes to El Salvador’s Notorious Prison to Rescue His “Totally American” Uncle

Congressman Matt Gaetz, known for his hardline stance on immigration and frequent appearances on Fox News, shocked the world when he arrived in El Salvador demanding entry into the infamous Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo (CECOT)—the country’s mega-prison filled with tens of thousands of gang members.

His mission? To rescue his long-lost uncle, Earl “Bubba” Gaetz III, a retired Florida RV salesman who was mistakenly deported during an immigration raid and somehow identified as a high-ranking Venezuelan gang leader.

## “My Uncle is NOT a Mara Salvatrucha!”

Standing outside the prison gates, flanked by two interns holding laminated copies of the U.S. Constitution, Gaetz passionately addressed the Salvadoran authorities.

“This is a travesty of justice,” he declared. “Bubba Gaetz is about as Venezuelan as a Cracker Barrel menu. He doesn’t even know where Venezuela is!”

He held up an old photo of Bubba—who bore a striking resemblance to a Guy Fieri stunt double—standing in front of his Florida swamp boat. “Does this look like a Marero to you?” Gaetz yelled.

The Salvadoran guards, unfazed, exchanged looks. One finally shrugged and responded, “Honestly? A little bit.”

## The Bureaucratic Nightmare

Inside, Gaetz was taken to an administrative office where a weary prison clerk handed him a 400-page file.

“Your tío, Señor Bubba Gaetz, was arrested in Miami during an ICE sweep. He was identified as ‘El Gringo Loco,’ a dangerous Venezuelan gang leader specializing in counterfeit fireworks and illegal beer pong tournaments,” the clerk explained.

“But Bubba doesn’t even speak Spanish!” Gaetz protested.

“Yes, which is why he was also charged with ‘pretending not to speak Spanish to evade justice,’” the clerk added.

Frustrated, Gaetz demanded to see his uncle in person. The guards reluctantly agreed, leading him down a long corridor filled with tattooed inmates glaring at the Florida congressman as he strutted past in his navy suit and cowboy boots.

## The Reunion: “Bubba! It’s Me, Matt!”

In a dimly lit cell, Gaetz finally found Bubba—who had adapted surprisingly well to prison life. Wearing an oversized tank top and sporting a fresh MS-13 tattoo (purely for survival, he assured his nephew), Bubba was busy arm-wrestling an inmate known only as “El Diablo.”

“Matty Boy! You came!” Bubba exclaimed, throwing his arms around Gaetz.

“Uncle Bubba, we’re getting you out of here,” Gaetz reassured him.

“Eh, I dunno, kiddo. Food’s decent, and I kinda run the bootlegging operation now. Did you know these guys have never even heard of Busch Light?”

Gaetz sighed. “No, Bubba. You are NOT a gang leader! You sell RVs to snowbirds in Tallahassee!”

## The Escape Plan

When Salvadoran authorities refused to release Bubba without proof that he wasn’t an international fugitive, Gaetz resorted to Plan B: A classic Florida maneuver—bribery.

Armed with nothing but a Get Out of Jail Free card from a Monopoly set and an offer of free Mar-a-Lago golf memberships, Gaetz tried to strike a deal.

Unsurprisingly, the Salvadoran officials laughed him out of the room.

“You can keep your Monopoly money, Señor Gaetz,” the warden chuckled. “Maybe next time, try a real offer—like Bitcoin.”

## The Aftermath

Realizing his rescue mission had failed, Gaetz returned to the U.S. and immediately blamed Joe Biden.

“This is what happens when Democrats let the border crisis get out of control,” he ranted on Fox News. “My innocent American uncle is rotting in a foreign prison, labeled a gang member, while REAL criminals get free Uber rides into our country!”

Meanwhile, back in CECOT, Bubba Gaetz was thriving. He had already launched El Bubba’s BBQ Emporium in the prison yard, selling smoked iguana ribs and contraband Mountain Dew.

As for his Venezuelan gang charges? Well, his Spanish was improving, and he was considering running for prison mayor.

Maybe Matt should’ve just let him be.
