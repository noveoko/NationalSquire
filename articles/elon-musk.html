                <div class="article-content">
                    <p>In a move that surprised absolutely no one, Elon Musk was appointed to lead the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). His mission? To streamline federal operations and, presumably, teach the government how to launch rockets without exploding.</p>

                    <h2>The Quest for Efficiency</h2>

                    <p>Determined to make a mark, Musk embarked on a mission to identify and eliminate wasteful spending. His first target? The Internal Revenue Service (IRS). "The IRS," Musk mused, "is like that one friend who always borrows money and never pays it back."</p>

                    <h2>Discovering the Golden Goose</h2>

                    <p>While sifting through mountains of paperwork‚Äîbecause who needs digital records?‚ÄîMusk stumbled upon a line item labeled "Miscellaneous Avian Assets". Intrigued, he followed the breadcrumbs (metaphorically, of course) and discovered a goose that laid golden eggs. "This," Musk declared, "is the kind of asset diversification I've been talking about."</p>

                    <h2>A New Tax Strategy</h2>

                    <p>Seeing an opportunity to revolutionize government funding, Musk proposed a bold plan:</p>

                    <p>"Why tax the people when we can tax this goose? It's laying golden eggs; surely that's some form of income."</p>

                    <p>The proposal was met with a mix of confusion, laughter, and the urgent need for stronger coffee.</p>

                    <h2>The IRS Responds</h2>

                    <p>Not ones to be outdone, the IRS fired back with a statement:</p>

                    <p>"While we appreciate innovative approaches to taxation, claiming a goose as a dependent is, quite frankly, fowl play."</p>

                    <h2>Public Reaction</h2>

                    <p>The public was divided. Some hailed Musk as a visionary, while others suggested he lay off the late-night Twitter brainstorming sessions. Memes flooded the internet, featuring Musk riding a golden egg-shaped rocket to Mars.</p>

                    <h2>The Legal Battle</h2>

                    <p>A court date was set. Musk arrived wearing a suit made entirely of golden egg shells, because subtlety has never been his strong suit. The judge, after a lengthy sigh, ruled that while the goose was indeed a taxpayer, it was not eligible for the standard deduction.</p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                    <p>In the end, the Golden Goose Initiative was shelved, not because it lacked merit, but because it lacked any understanding of tax law. Musk returned to his mission of making electric cars that drive themselves, leaving the IRS to continue its never-ending quest to find out if anyone actually understands their tax forms.</p>

                    <h2>Moral of the Story</h2>

                    <p>When in doubt, consult a tax professional. And maybe don't let Elon Musk run your country's efficiency department.</p>
